       <p>Hello, my name is Jen. I'm a shapeshifter. People have told me I look or sound like someone they know.<br><br>

        I look young but I know how to use a semicolon and keep a spreadsheet on my business expenses. I'm the type to use the Marie Kondo folding method. I give a shit about lots of things like climate change, suffering, history, animals, and line height. I'm an artist, writer, and developer; this website shows off my dev skills.<br><br>

        I've been dabbling with dev since 2014. As an artist I was first really resistant to learning anything more rigourously technical but I soon got sucked into it as a means to a visual end. I got into coding somewhere between MySpace and making YouTube videos. Later on I taught creative code at art school. People invited me to speak at conferences and I have published in books. That was fun, but I enjoyed the learning part more than teaching.<br><br>

        I thought, "Why spend my waking hours cramming code to teach when I could just code all day?"
        <br><br>
        Since then I have worked in an office, as a consultant, at an agency, remotely, for a non-profit, and a software company. I have
        interned, thrice. I've weathered many periods of un(der)employment. I know this is terrible for my branding; I'm giving you this self-destructively earnest preamble just to say: Like any millennial out there, I don't know what I'm doing or how far I'll go. But as a matter of principle when I'm talking about myself, I won't sugarcoat. I do what I love and I love what I do. :) <br><br>
        Thanks for reading!<br>
